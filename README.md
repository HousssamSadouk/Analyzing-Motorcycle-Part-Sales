# Analyzing-Motorcycle-Part-Sales

In this project, I used SQL to analyze a dataset of motorcycle part sales. The dataset contained information about the sales of different types of motorcycle parts, including their sales volume, revenue, and profit margins. The goal of the project was to gain insights into the sales trends of motorcycle parts and identify the most profitable product categories.
